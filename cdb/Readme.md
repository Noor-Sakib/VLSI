# Current Distribution Block <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/4350/4350670.png" width="35">

This project showcases the end-to-end physical design of a high-density analog Current Distribution Block with 972 transistors. The primary challenge was managing the complexities of manual placement and routing in a dense environment to ensure device matching and signal integrity, culminating in a 100% DRC and LVS clean layout using Cadence tools.
